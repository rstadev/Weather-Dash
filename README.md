  ## Description
  This project was assigned during the Georgia Tech Full Stack Flex Development Program. The aim of this project was to create from scratch a working Weather Forcast Dashboard Application. Meaning when a user enters in a desired city, they would be met with the current weather for said city, the five day forcast of that city, and their search entered in to a past searches field. The app should be complete,and functions correctly according to the assigned requirements.
